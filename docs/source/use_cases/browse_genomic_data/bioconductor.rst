`Bioconductor`_ provides a convenient way to browse regions of the genome. |browse-reads|

.. code-block:: shell

  require(ggbio)
  require(GoogleGenomics)

  GoogleGenomics::authenticate("/PATH/TO/YOUR/client_secrets.json")

  galignments <- getReads(readGroupSetId="CMvnhpKTFhDnk4_9zcKO3_YB", chromosome="17",
                          start=41218200, end=41218500, converter=readsToGAlignments)

A more extensive example of read browsing with `Bioconductor`_ is documented towards the end of codelab  `Data Analysis using Google Genomics <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/blob/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis/AllModalitiesDemo.md#visualize-reads-with-bioconductor>`__.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into `Google Genomics`_.  See :doc:`/use_cases/load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.

(2) If you do not have them already, install the necessary `Bioconductor`_ packages.  See `Using Bioconductor`_ for more detail as to how to do this.  Alternatively, you can :doc:`/use_cases/run_familiar_tools/bioconductor`.

(3) Update the parameters to the ``getReads`` call the example above to match that of your data and desired genomic region to view.
