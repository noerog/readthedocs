To make use of this on your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See `Load Genomic Variants`_ for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Copy and modify one of the queries in https://github.com/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/tree/master/platinumGenomes so that it will perform a `JOIN <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#join-types>`_ command against your table.
(3) Run the revised query with BigQuery to join the Tute table with your variants and materialize the result to a new table.  Notice in the screenshot below the destination table and 'Allow Large Results' is checked.
