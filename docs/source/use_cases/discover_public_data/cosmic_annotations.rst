COSMIC Annotations
==================

The Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) has made
`COSMIC <https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/about>`_
available as BigQuery tables to provide a new way to explore and understand
the mutations driving cancer. 

See ISB-CGC's documentation for full details:
