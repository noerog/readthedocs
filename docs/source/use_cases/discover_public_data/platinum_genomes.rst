Provenance
----------

* The source files for this data include:
   * All of the BAM files listed at `the EBI FTP site <ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ERA172/ERA172924/bam>`_.
   * All of the VCF files were listed at `the Illumina FTP site <ftp://ussd-ftp.illumina.com/>`_ prior to the IlluminaPlatinumGenomes_v6.0 release but they have since been taken down.
* These files were copied to Google Cloud Storage, uploaded to Google Genomics, and the variants were exported to Google BigQuery.
