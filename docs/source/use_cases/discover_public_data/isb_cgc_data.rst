Use the power of BigQuery to analyze the wealth of data created by `The Cancer Genome Atlas <http://cancergenome.nih.gov/>`_ (TCGA) project!

The Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) has created and made public a dataset based on the open-access TCGA data including somatic mutation calls, clinical data, mRNA and miRNA expression, DNA methylation and protein expression from 33 different tumor types. It's part of their `Cancer Genomics Cloud`_, funded by the National Cancer Institute. They've also created public github repositories  so you can try out sample queries and analyses in R or `Google Cloud Datalab`_.
