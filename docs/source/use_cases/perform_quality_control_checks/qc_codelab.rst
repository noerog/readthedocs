There are a collection of quality control checks for variants documented in codelab `Quality Control using Google Genomics`_.  The methods include:

* Sample Level

  * Genome Call Rate
  * Missingness Rate
  * Singleton Rate
  * Heterozygosity Rate
  * Homozygosity Rate
  * Inbreeding Coefficient
  * Sex Inference
  * Ethnicity Inference
  * Genome Similarity

* Variant Level

  * Ti/Tv by Genomic Window
  * Ti/Tv by Alternate Allele Counts
  * Ti/Tv by Depth
  * Missingness Rate
  * Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
  * Heterozygous Haplotype

These methods were co-developed with researchers working on the Million Veterans Program data. For more detail, please see `the paper <http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/24/035295>`__ and `diagram of their full pipeline <https://github.com/StanfordBioinformatics/mvp_aaa_codelabs/blob/master/README.md>`__ with some additional quality control checks on `github <https://github.com/StanfordBioinformatics/mvp_aaa_codelabs>`__.

To make use of this codelab upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See `Load Genomic Variants`_ for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Each section of `the codelab <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/PlatinumGenomes-QC>`_ discusses how to run that part on your own data.  For example, update the BigQuery table name in `Part 1: Data Overview <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/blob/master/R/PlatinumGenomes-QC/Data-Overview.md#variants>`_
