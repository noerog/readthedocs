Linkage disequilibrium was run separately for each `super population and sub population <http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel>`_ within :doc:`/use_cases/discover_public_data/1000_genomes` phase 3 variants using the method defined in Box 1 of:

| `Linkage disequilibrium - understanding the evolutionary past and mapping the medical future <http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v9/n6/full/nrg2361.html>`_
| Slatkin, Montgomery
| Nature Reviews Genetics, Volume 9, Issue 6, 477 - 485
| DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg2361
|

LD was computed for all pairs of variants within a window of 1,000,000 bp (1 megabase) and all pairs with absolute allelic correation of 0.4 are retained.   See :doc:`/use_cases/linkage_disequilibrium/compute_linkage_disequilibrium` for more detail.

The `output files <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data/linkage-disequilibrium/1000-genomes-phase-3/ldCutoff0.4_window1MB/>`_ were split by chromosome with `output columns <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium#linkage-disequilibrium-calculation-pipeline>`_ indicating the identity of each pair of values and the resulting LD value. The output files have also been `loaded into BigQuery <https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/genomics-public-data:linkage_disequilibrium_1000G_phase_3?pli=1>`_ with the same columns. Examples of using BigQuery to analyze LD are `available as Datalab notebooks <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/tree/master/datalab>`_.
