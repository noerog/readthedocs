There are several examples of interacting with LD results stored in BigQuery using Datalab in GitHub. The examples are all part of the `linkage disequilibrium project <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/tree/master/datalab>`_.

* Exploring `summary statistics of LD data <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/blob/master/datalab/Exploring_Linkage_Disequilibrium_Data.ipynb>`_.
* `Visualizing LD patterns <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/blob/master/datalab/Visualizing_Regional_LD.ipynb>`_ in specific genomic regions.
* Examining the rate of `LD decay <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/blob/master/datalab/LD_decay.ipynb>`_ as a function of distance.
* Selecting "tag variants" and visualizing `tag variant distributions <https://github.com/googlegenomics/linkage-disequilibrium/blob/master/datalab/Tag_variant_identification.ipynb>`_.
