`Google BigQuery`_ can be used to perform a GWAS.  Here are several examples:

* Chi-squared tests on :doc:`/use_cases/discover_public_data/1000_genomes` dataset with members of EAS super population as case and control all other populations:

  * iPythonNotebook `Genome-wide association study (GWAS).ipynb <https://github.com/googlegenomics/datalab-examples/blob/master/datalab/genomics/Genome-wide%20association%20study%20(GWAS).ipynb>`_
  * SQL `gwas-pattern-chi-squared-test.sql <https://github.com/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/blob/master/1000genomes/sql/gwas-pattern-chi-squared-test.sql>`_

* Two-proportion Z test on :doc:`/use_cases/discover_public_data/1000_genomes` dataset with members of EAS super population as case and control all other populations:

  * SQL `gwas-pattern-two-proportion-z-test.sql <https://github.com/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/blob/master/1000genomes/sql/gwas-pattern-two-proportion-z-test.sql>`_

* Chi-squared test on :doc:`/use_cases/discover_public_data/1000_genomes` dataset with case and control determined by clustering from a PCA:

  * R package vignette `AllModalitiesDemo.md <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/blob/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis/AllModalitiesDemo.md>`__
  * written as a codelab `AllModalitiesDemo.md <https://github.com/googlegenomics/bioconductor-workshop-r/blob/master/inst/doc/AllModalitiesDemo.md>`__

To run this on your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See `Load Genomic Variants`_ for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) For data with non-variant segments (e.g, `gVCF` or `Complete Genomics`_ data), reshape the data into multi-sample variants format via :doc:`/use_cases/load_data/multi_sample_variants`
