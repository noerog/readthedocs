The R client
------------

The `GoogleGenomics Bioconductor package`_ provides R methods to search for and retreive Reads and Variants stored in the Google Genomics API.

Additionally it provides converters to `Bioconductor`_ datatypes such as:

* `GAlignments <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicAlignments.html>`_
* `GRanges <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html>`_
* `VRanges <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html>`_
